New: There is now a new initial composition model called 'ascii data
slice' that can can read in 3d ascii datasets into a 2d model and
otherwise works like the ascii data initial composition model. This
allows it to make high-resolution 2d models of problems that use
observational data (such as seismic tomography models).
