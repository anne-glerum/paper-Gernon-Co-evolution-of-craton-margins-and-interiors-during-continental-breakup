Changed: The Steinberger model now uses the hydrostatic pressure
rather than the full pressure to compute the material properties from
the thermodynamic lookup equation of state (density, etc.). This is
consistent with the projected density approximation and avoids
convergence issues of the nonlinear solver related to jumps of material
properties at phase transitions, which are common in thermodynamic
lookup tables. At the same time, using the full pressure does not really
make the results more accurate since the dynamic pressure is so small
that it changes material properties very little otherwise (not more than
0.1% even in the most extreme cases).
