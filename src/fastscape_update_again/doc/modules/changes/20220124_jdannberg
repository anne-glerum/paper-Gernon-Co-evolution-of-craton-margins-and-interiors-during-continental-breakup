Fixed: The simple version of the steinberger viscosity profile data
file now correctly excludes both the top and bottom boundary layer.
These need to be removed from the original profile in case the
model uses a temperature-dependent viscosity based on the adiabatic
profile (rather than the laterally averaged temperature). Otherwise
the temperature effect will be included twice. The old version of
the file had excluded the top, but not the bottom boundary layer.
