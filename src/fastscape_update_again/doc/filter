#
# Now, as of doxygen 1.5, this still produces the wrong result, but
# that's not our fault. This is reported here:

# doxygen version 1.7.1 and later have the habit of thinking that
# everything that starts with "file:" is the beginning of a link,
# but we occasionally use this in our tutorials in the form
# "...this functionality is declared in the following header file:",
# where it leads to a non-functional link. We can avoid the problem
# by replacing a "file:" at the end of a line with the text
# "file :", which doxygen doesn't recognize:
s#file:[ \t]*$#file :#g;
