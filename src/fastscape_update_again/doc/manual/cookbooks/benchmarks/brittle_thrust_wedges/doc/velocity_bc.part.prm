# Spatial domain of different compositional fields:
# Quartz sand (qsand) has two layers with 1 cm thickness each.
# Corundum sand (csand) is in the middle of the 2-layer quatz sand and is 
# 1 cm thick.
# The boundary 2-mm-thin layers (bound) sit on both the bottom of the domain and
# between the sand and rigid indenter block. The right boundary has a constant 
# inflow velocity, which pushes a rigid block that approximates a mobile wall. 
# Movement of the rigid block drives deformation in the sand layers. 
# The boundary between the rigid block and boundary layers produces a sharp 
# velocity discontinuity that localizes brittle deformation.
# The sticky air layer is set on top of the sand layer and approximates a 
# free surface.

subsection Boundary velocity model

  set Tangential velocity boundary indicators        = left      #free slip

# right - material inflow with a velocity of 2.5 cm/hour at the height of 
# the pushing block. The velocity linearly decreases from the base of the 
# rigid block to 0 cm/hour at the base of the model.

# The top boundary is open (zero traction), which allows the sticky air to 
# flow freely through it as topography develops along the wedge. Additional 
# testing revealed that using a true free surface leads to significant mesh 
# distortion and associated numerical instabilities.
