It creates a number of spherical high-viscosity, high-density sinking
spheres in a box geometry that provide a challenge for the Stokes
preconditioner. The difficulty of the problem is determined by the
number of sinkers and the viscosity contrast between sinkers and
background, which can be adjusted in the parameter file.
