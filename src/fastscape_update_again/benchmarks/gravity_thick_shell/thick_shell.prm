# A simple setup for testing the gravity postprocessor using the
# sample scheme 'list of points'. The domain is a 2891 km thick
# shell of constant density, i.e. the Earth mantle.
# An analytical solution exists for the gravitational acceleration
# and potential so that values returned by the gravity postprocessor
# can be benchmarked on a line from the center of the planet to
# 10,000 km outside.
# See the corresponding section in the manual for more information.
