# This parameter file modifies the benchmark viscoelastic_stress_build-up.prm
# to use the Visco Plastic material model and include a constant
# yield stress of 100 MPa. Without the imposed yield stress, the viscoelastic
# stress will build up to ~ 200 MPa. However, the imposed yield stress will
# truncate the viscoelastic stresses at the yield stress magnitude.
# For additional information on the model setup and analytical solution,
# see viscoelastic_stress_build-up.prm, which is located in this folder.
#
# The results can be observed by viewing the compositional field values
# representing the horizontal (ve_stress_xx) or vertical (ve_stress_yy) components
# of the viscoelastic stress tensor. Significantly, the stress near the
# model boundaries is incorrect due to the compositional field boundary
# conditions, which are based on the initial compositional values (e.g., zero).
# This leads to oscillations in the stress field near the boundaries, which
# decay towards a constant value in the model interior as the stresses build up to
# 100 MPa.
