# Like checkpoint_01, but in parallel. This test resumes from the checkpoint
# written by checkpoint_05_mpi_write.  In order for this to work, this test
# loads a shared library that copies the necessary checkpoint files into the
# output directory of this test before starting the run.
#
# MPI: 2
# DEPENDS-ON: checkpoint_05_mpi_create
