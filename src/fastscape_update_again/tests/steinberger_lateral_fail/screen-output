**** Warning: When computing depth averages, there is at least one depth band
     that does not have any quadrature points in it.
     Consider reducing the number of depth layers for averaging.

TimerOutput objects finalize timed values printed to the
screen by communicating over MPI in their destructors.
Since an exception is currently uncaught, this
synchronization (and subsequent output) will be skipped
to avoid a possible deadlock.
