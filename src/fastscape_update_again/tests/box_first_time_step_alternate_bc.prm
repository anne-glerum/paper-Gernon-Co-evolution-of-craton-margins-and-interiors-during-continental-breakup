# This is a copy of the box_first_time_step.prm. The difference is this: One
# can mark boundaries as having zero velocity, or one can mark them as having
# Dirichlet velocity boundary conditions and then select that the boundary
# function should in fact be zero. The result should of course be the
# same. This test verifies that this is indeed so.
