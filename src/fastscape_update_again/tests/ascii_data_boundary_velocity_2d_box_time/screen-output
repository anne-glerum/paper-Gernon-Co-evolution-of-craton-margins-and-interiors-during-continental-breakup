   From this timestep onwards, ASPECT will not attempt to load new Ascii data files.
   This is either because ASPECT has already read all the files necessary to impose
   the requested boundary condition, or that the last available file has been read.
   If the Ascii data represented a time-dependent boundary condition,
   that time-dependence ends at this timestep  (i.e. the boundary condition
   will continue unchanged from the last known state into the future).
