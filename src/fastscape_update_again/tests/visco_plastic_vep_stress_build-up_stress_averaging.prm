# This test checks viscoelastic stress buildup with a
# constant strain rate and an elastic time step equal
# to a user-specified constant elastic time step. This
# fixed elastic time step is double the numerical time step.
# Stress averaging is used to account for the difference
# between the numerical and elastic time step. Viscoelastic
# stresses (sigma_xx, sigma_yy, sigma_xy) are tracked
# with compositional fields. The parameter file is derived
# from the 2D viscoelastic_stress_build-up benchmark with
# modifications to the resolution, end time, material
# properties and postprocessors.
