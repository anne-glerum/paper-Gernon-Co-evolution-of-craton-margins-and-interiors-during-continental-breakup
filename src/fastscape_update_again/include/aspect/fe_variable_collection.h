   * std::vector of these structs will be converted into an ordered collection of
   * objects of type FEVariable represented by FEVariableCollection to form the

   *
   * Blocks are used to extract or solve for certain variables separately or
   * in block based preconditioners.  As an example, in a Stokes problem one
   * might want velocity and pressure in a single block (for use with a direct
   * solver), or one block for all velocity components and a second block for
   * the pressure (for a Schur complement-based preconditioner), or separate
   * blocks for pressure and each velocity component.
