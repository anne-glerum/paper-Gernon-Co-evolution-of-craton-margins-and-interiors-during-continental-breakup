   * A mesh refinement criterion that computes

   * of particles. In practice this plugin
   * equilibrates the number of particles per cell,
   * leading to fine cells in high particle density regions
   * and coarse cells in low particle density regions.
   * This plugin is mostly useful for models with inhomogeneous
   * particle density, e.g. when tracking an initial interface
   * with a high particle density, or when the spatial particle
   * density denotes the region of interest. Additionally, this
   * plugin tends to balance the computational load between
   * processes in parallel computations, because the particle
   * and mesh density is more aligned.
