         * 1. At the inner core boundary the adiabatic temperature should be equal to solidus temperature
         * 2. The following energy production rate should be balanced in core:
         *    Heat flux at core-mantle boundary         Q
         *    Specific heat                             Qs*dT/dt

         *    So that         Q+Qs*dT/dt+Qr+Qg*dR/dt*Ql*dR/dt=0
         * 3. The light component composition X depends on inner core radius (See function get_X() ),
         *    and core solidus may dependent on X as well.
         *    This becomes a small nonlinear problem. Directly iterate through the above three equations doesn't
         *    converge well. Alternatively we solve the inner core radius by bisection method.
         *    A single solution between fully liquid and fully solid core is expected. Otherwise this function will throw exception and terminate.
         *
         *    At Earth core condition, a inner core is forming at the center of the Earth and surrounded by a liquid outer core.
         *    However, the core solidus is influenced by light components (e.g. S) and its slope is very closed to core adiabatic. So there is an alternative
         *    scenario that the crystallization happens first at the core mantle boundary instead of at the center, which is called a 'snowing core'
         *    (Stewart, A. J., et al. (2007). "Mars: a new core-crystallization regime." Science 316(5829): 1323-1325.). This also
         *    provides a valid solution for the solver. So the returning bool is set to true for normal core, and false for 'snowing core'.
         *    TODO: The current code is only able to treat normal core scenario, treating 'snowing core' scenario may be possible and could be added.
