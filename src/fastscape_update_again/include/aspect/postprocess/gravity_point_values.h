     * A postprocessor that computes gravity, gravity anomalies, gravity potential and
     * gravity gradients for a set of points (e.g. satellites) in or above the model
     * surface for a user-defined range of latitudes, longitudes and radius, or a list
     * of point coordinates. Spherical coordinates in the output file are radius,
     * colatitude and colongitude. Gravity is here based on the density distribution
     * from the material model (and non adiabatic). This means that the density may
     * come directly from an ascii file. This postprocessor also computes theoretical
     * gravity and its derivatives, which corresponds to the analytical solution of gravity
     * in the same geometry but filled with a reference density. The reference density
     * is also used to determine the density difference for computing gravity anomalies.
     * Thus one must carefully evaluate the meaning of the gravity anomaly output,
     * because the solution may not reflect the actual gravity anomaly (due to
     * differences in the assumed reference density). One way to guarantee correct
     * gravity anomalies is to subtract the gravity of a certain point from the average
     * gravity on the map. Another way is to directly use density anomalies for this
     * postprocessor.
     * The average- minimum- and maximum gravity acceleration and potential are written
     * into the statistics file.
