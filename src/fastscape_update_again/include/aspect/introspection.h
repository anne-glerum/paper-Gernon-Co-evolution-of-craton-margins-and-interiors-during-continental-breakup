   * variables (e.g., earlier versions of ASPECT had many places where we
   * built a scalar FEValues extractor at component 'dim' since that is where
   * we knew that the pressure lies in the finite element; this kind of
   * implicit knowledge is no longer necessary with the Introspection class).
   * The Introspection class is used both by the Simulator class itself, but
   * is also exported to plugins via the SimulatorAccess class.
