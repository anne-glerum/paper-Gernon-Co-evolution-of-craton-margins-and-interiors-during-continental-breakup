    /**
     * A material model based on a viscous rheology including diffusion and
     * dislocation creep.
     *
     * The effective viscosity is defined as the harmonic mean of the two
     * effective viscosity functions describing diffusion and dislocation creep:
     * @f[
     *   v_\text{eff} = \left( \frac{1}{v_\text{eff}^\text{diff}} + \frac{1}{v_\text{eff}^\text{dis}} \right)^{-1}
     * @f]
     * where
     * @f[
     *   v_\text{eff}^\text{diff} = A_\text{diff}^{-1} \exp\left(\frac{E_\text{diff} + PV_\text{diff}}{RT}\right),
     * @f]
     * and
     * @f[
     *   v_\text{eff}^\text{dis} =  A_\text{dis}^{\frac{-1}{n_\text{dis}}} \dot{\varepsilon}^{\frac{1-n}{n}}
     *                        \exp\left(\frac{E_\text{diff} + PV_\text{diff}}{n_\text{dis}RT}\right)
     * @f]
     * where $\dot{\varepsilon}$ is the second invariant of the strain rate tensor,
     * $A_i$ are prefactors where $i$ corresponds to diffusion or dislocation creep,
     * $E_i$ are the activation energies, $V_i$ are the activation volumes,
     * $\rho_m$ is the mantle density, $R$ is the gas constant,
     * $T$ is temperature, and $P$ is pressure.
     *
     * Several model parameters (reference densities, thermal expansivities
     * and rheology parameters) can be defined per-compositional field.
     * For each material parameter the user supplies a comma delimited list of
     * length N+1, where N is the number of compositional fields.  The
     * additional field corresponds to the value for background mantle.  They
     * should be ordered ``background, composition1, composition2...''
     *
     * If a list of values is given for the density and thermal expansivity,
     * the volume weighted sum of the values of each of the compositional fields
     * is used in their place, for example
     * $\rho = \sum \left( \rho_i V_i \right)$
     *
     * The individual output viscosities for each compositional field are
     * also averaged. The user can choose from a range of options for this
     * viscosity averaging. If only one value is given for any of these parameters,
     * all compositions are assigned the same value.
     * The first value in the list is the value assigned to "background mantle"
     * (regions where the sum of the compositional fields is < 1.0).
