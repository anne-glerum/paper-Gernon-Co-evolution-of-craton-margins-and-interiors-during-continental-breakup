     * An enum to define what kind of averaging operations are implemented.
     * These are:
     *
     * - No averaging, i.e., leave the values as they were provided by the
     * material model.
     *
     * - Arithmetic averaging: Set the values of each output quantity at
     * every quadrature point to \f[ \bar x = \frac 1Q \sum_{q=1}^Q x_q \f]
     * where $x_q$ are the values at the $Q$ quadrature points.
     *
     * - Harmonic averaging: Set the values of each output quantity at every
     * quadrature point to \f[ \bar x = \left(\frac 1Q \sum_{q=1}^Q
     * \frac{1}{x_q}\right)^{-1} \f] where $x_q$ are the values at the $Q$
     * quadrature points.
     *
     * - Geometric averaging: Set the values of each output quantity at
     * every quadrature point to \f[ \bar x = \left(\prod_{q=1}^Q
     * x_q\right)^{1/Q} \f] where $x_q$ are the values at the $Q$ quadrature
     * points.
     *
     * - Pick largest: Set the values of each output quantity at every
     * quadrature point to \f[ \bar x = \max_{1\le q\le Q} x_q \f] where $x_q$
     * are the values at the $Q$ quadrature points.
     *
     * - Log average: Set the values of each output quantity at every
     * quadrature point to \f[ \bar x = {10}^{\frac 1Q \sum_{q=1}^Q \log_{10}
     * x_q} \f] where $x_q$ are the values at the $Q$ quadrature points.
     *
     * - NWD Arithmetic averaging: Set the values of each output quantity at
     * every quadrature point to \f[ \bar x = \frac {\sum_{q=1}^Q W_q * x_q}
     * {\sum_{q=1}^Q W_q} \f] where $x_q$ are the values and $w$ the weights
     * at the $Q$ quadrature points.
     *
     * - NWD Harmonic averaging: Set the values of each output quantity at every
     * quadrature point to \f[ \bar x = \frac{\sum_{q=1}^Q w_q }{ \sum_{q=1}^Q
     * \frac{w_q}{x_q}} \f] where $x_q$ are the values and $w$ the weights at
     * the $Q$ quadrature points.
     *
     * - NWD Geometric averaging: Set the values of each output quantity at
     * every quadrature point to \f[ \bar x = \frac{ \sum_{q=1}^Q w_q x_q}
     * {\sum_{q=1}^Q w_q} \f] where $x_q$ are the values and $w$ the weights
     * at the $Q$ quadrature points.
