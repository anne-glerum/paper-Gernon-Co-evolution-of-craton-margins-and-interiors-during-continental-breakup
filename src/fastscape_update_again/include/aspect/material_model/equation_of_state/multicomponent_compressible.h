      /**
       * A compressible equation of state that is intended for use with multiple compositional
       * fields. For each material property, the user supplies a comma delimited list of
       * length N+1, where N is the number of compositional fields used in the computation.
       * The first entry corresponds to the "background" (which is also why there are N+1 entries).
       *
       * If a single value is given, then all the compositional fields are given
       * that value. Other lengths of lists are not allowed. The material parameters
       * for each compositional field are calculated self-consistently,
       * assuming a constant pressure derivative of the isothermal bulk modulus ($K_T'$)
       * at the reference temperature (i.e. a Murnaghan equation of state),
       * a constant ratio of the thermal expansivity ($\alpha$) and
       * isothermal compressibility ($\beta_T$), and a constant isochoric
       * specific heat $C_v$. This leads to the following expressions for the material
       * properties of each material:
       *
       * $\rho(p,T) = \rho_0 f^{1/K_T'}$
       * $C_p(p,T) = C_v + (\alpha T \frac{\alpha}{\beta} f^{-1-(1/K_T')} / \rho_0)$
       * $\alpha(p, T) = \alpha_0/f$
       * $\beta_T(p, T) = \beta_0/f$
       * $f = (1 + (p - \frac{\alpha}{\beta}(T-T_0)) K_T' \beta)$.
       *
       * where $\rho$ is the density and $C_p$ is the isobaric heat capacity.
       * $f$ is a scaling factor for $\alpha$ and $\beta_T$.
