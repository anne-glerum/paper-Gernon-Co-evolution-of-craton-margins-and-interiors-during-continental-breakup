Python contributions for ASPECT 
==============================

This folder contains some useful routines to read files with Python,
using the numpy and pandas packages.

To install Python with anaconda: 
https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

To create a new environment with numpy, pandas and matplotlib:
>> conda create --name py36 python=3.6 numpy matplotlib pandas 

To use the jupyter notebook, you will need to install it in your conda environment:
>> conda install jupyter

You may also want to use jupyter lab:
>> conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab

And the next step is to start the server for the jupyter notebooks (on your computer)
>> jupyter notebook
It will open a page on your favorite web browser. Double click on the file .ipynb
and you are all set!
