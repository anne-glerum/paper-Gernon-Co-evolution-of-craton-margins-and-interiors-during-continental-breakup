# Earth-like parameters. To achieve this, we set all material
# properties to multiples of 10, and then control the three important
# model parameters by setting:
#
# k = 2.460375e7 / Ra,                                      to control the Rayleigh number,
# deltarho = 2 alpha rho DeltaT = 200 kg/m3,                to achieve Rb = 2Ra, as in Christensen & Yuen,
# gamma = P * Ra/Rb * rho g h / DeltaT = P/2 * 1.35e7 Pa/K, to set the phase buoyancy parameter.
