# A description of the van Keken et al. benchmark using smooth initial
# conditions instead of the discontinuous ones in
# van-keken-discontinuous.prm. See the manual for more information.
# This test adds particles to the cookbook parameter file, and therefore
# tests the behaviour of the particles.
