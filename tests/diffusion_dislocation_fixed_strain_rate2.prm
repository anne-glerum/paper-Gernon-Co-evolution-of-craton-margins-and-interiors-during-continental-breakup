# This is a modification of the diffusion_dislocation_fixed_strain_rate
# test, where only the temperature and the strain rate are different.
# It tests if the diffusion dislocation model also works correctly if
# material model inputs are slightly outside the range of what is usually
# encountered in the mantle.
