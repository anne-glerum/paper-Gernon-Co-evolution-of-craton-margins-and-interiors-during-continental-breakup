# A test based on the particle version of the SolKz benchmark that (1) tests to
# ensure that additional particles are added to the model during the computation
# with multiple properties on the particles and (2) tests to ensure that the
# particle methodology when used with the Quadratic Least Squares Particle
# Interpolation algorithm correctly computes the particle version of the Solkz
# benchmark.
