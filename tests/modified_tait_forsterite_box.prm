# The following properties are for forsterite.
# They are taken from Holland and Powell (2011).
# Note that the heat capacity function had to be converted
# from a molar basis to mass basis
# (Cp(specific) = Cp(molar)/molar_mass)
# The Einstein temperature is calculated empirically from the
# expression in Holland and Powell
# (Einstein temperature  = 10636 / (S/n + 6.44)), where
# S is the standard state molar entropy and n is the number of atoms
# per formula unit.
