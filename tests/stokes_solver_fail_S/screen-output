TimerOutput objects finalize timed values printed to the
screen by communicating over MPI in their destructors.
Since an exception is currently uncaught, this
synchronization (and subsequent output) will be skipped
to avoid a possible deadlock.


Exception 'ExcMessage (exception_message.str())' on rank 0 on processing: 

An error occurred in file <utilities.cc> in function
(line in output replaced by default.sh script)
The violated condition was: 
    false
Additional information: 
    The iterative Stokes solver in Simulator::solve_stokes did not
    converge.
    
    The initial residual was: 1.169088e+14
    The final residual is: 1.169088e+14
    The required residual for convergence is: 1.169088e+07
    See output-stokes_solver_fail_S/solver_history.txt for the full
    convergence history.
