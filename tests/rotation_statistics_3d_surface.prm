# This test is based on 'rotation_statistics_3d', with the modification
# that the sphere rotates with a radially varying angular velocity of
# w=r instead of w=1. Since our sphere has a radius of 1 this means the
# volume net rotation is different from 'rotation_statistics_3d', but
# the surface net rotation should still be 1, which the postprocessor
# 'rotation statistics' reports correctly.
