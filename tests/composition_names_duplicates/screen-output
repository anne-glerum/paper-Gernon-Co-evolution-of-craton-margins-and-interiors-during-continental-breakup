   Postprocessing:


An exception happened on MPI process <0> while running the visualization postprocessor <N6aspect11Postprocess27VisualizationPostprocessors18MaterialPropertiesILi2EEE>: 

An error occurred in file <visualization.cc> in function
(line in output replaced by default.sh script)
The violated condition was: 
    iterator_and_success.second == true
Additional information: 
    The output variable <density> already exists in the list of output
    variables. Make sure there is no duplication in the names of
    visualization output variables, otherwise output files may be
    corrupted.

Aborting!
MPI_ABORT was invoked on rank 0 in communicator MPI_COMM_WORLD
with errorcode 1.

NOTE: invoking MPI_ABORT causes Open MPI to kill all MPI processes.
You may or may not see output from other processes, depending on
exactly when Open MPI kills them.
