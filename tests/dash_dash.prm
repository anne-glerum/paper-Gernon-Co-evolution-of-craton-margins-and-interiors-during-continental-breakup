# Test that we indeed read from stdin when the input file is given as "--"

# This .prm file is really a sham. Its only purpose is to set up a test that
# automatically loads a shared library that only starts aspect (again!) with
# "--" as argument, and when that has finished running terminates the original
# copy of aspect. In other words, the original aspect is only used to load a
# shared library, nothing else, and so the contents of the current .prm file do
# not matter.
