# A test for the particle load balancing strategy 'repartition'.
#
# The load is distributed according to a balanced weight defined
# as: n_locally_owned_cells + particle_weight/1000 * n_locally_owned_particles.
# This test uses a large particle weight to ensure a good particle distribution
# at the cost of an imbalance in the cell distribution.

# MPI: 4
