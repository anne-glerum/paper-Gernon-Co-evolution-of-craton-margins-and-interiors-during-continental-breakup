set Max nonlinear iterations               = 10
set Nonlinear solver tolerance             = 1e-5

# The end time is chosen in such a way that the solitary wave travels
# approximately 5 times its wavelength during the model time.
set End time                               = 6e6

# To model melt migration, there has to be a compositional field with 
# the name 'porosity'. 
subsection Compositional fields
  set Number of fields = 1
  set Names of fields = porosity
end

# Enable modelling of melt migration in addition to the advection of
# solid material.
subsection Melt settings
  set Include melt transport                  = true
end

######### Parameters for the porosity field ########################

# We use the initial conditions and material model from the 
# solitary wave plugin and choose a wave with an amplitude of
# 0.01 and a background porosity of 0.001. 
subsection Initial composition model
  set Model name = Solitary wave initial condition
  subsection Solitary wave initial condition
    set Offset = 200
    set Read solution from file = true
    set Amplitude = 0.01
    set Background porosity = 0.001
  end
end

subsection Material model
  set Model name = Solitary Wave
end

# As material is flowing in, we prescribe the porosity at the
# upper and lower boundary. 
subsection Boundary composition model
  set List of model names = initial composition
  set Fixed composition boundary indicators   = 2,3
end

# As we know that our solution does not have any steep gradients
# we can use a low stabilization to avoid too much diffusion.

    set beta  = 0.001

######### Model geometry ##############################################

# Our domain is a pseudo-1D-profile 400 m in height, but only a few elements wide
subsection Geometry model
  set Model name = box
  subsection Box
    set X extent  = 10
    set Y extent  = 400
    set Y repetitions = 40

end

######### Velocity boundary conditions ################################

# We apply the phase speed of the wave here, so that it always stays in the 
# same place in our model. The phase speed is c = 5.25e-11 m/s, but we have 
# to convert it to m/years using the same conversion that is used internally 
# in ASPECT: year_in_seconds = 60*60*24*365.2425.
subsection Boundary velocity model
  set Tangential velocity boundary indicators = 0,1
  set Prescribed velocity boundary indicators = 2:function, 3:function
