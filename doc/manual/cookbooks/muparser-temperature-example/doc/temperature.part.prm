# Half-space cooling model increasing with age from x>0 to xtr
# For x>xtr, half-space cooling model with a fixed age.
# Note, we use 1-erfc instead of erf because the muparser in dealii 
# only knows about erfc. Also, we need to use ymax-y since y=0 at the
# bottom of the box.
# vsub is the velocity of the subducting plate in m/s 
# (x/vsub is the age of the subducting plate)
# ageop is the age of the overriding plate in seconds.
# Tm is the mantle temperature, Ts is the surface temperature in kelvin
# kappa is the thermal diffusivity (m^2/s)
