# Refine the upper 150 km of the mesh so lithosphere structure is resolved.
# Function expression asks if the depth is less than the lithosphere depth and
# then refinement level = 7, else refinement level = 0. 
# Note, the minimum refinement level for the lower 850 km of the mesh would be 
# coarser than the initial one level of global refinement. This would then lead
# to coarsening in the future. 
# To avoid this, you may want to set this 'else' value to the same as the number
# of initial global refinement steps.
