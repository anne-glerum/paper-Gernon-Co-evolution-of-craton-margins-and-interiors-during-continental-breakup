# Because the model includes reactions that might be on a faster time scale 
# than the time step of the model (melting and the freezing of melt), we use
# the operator splitting scheme.

    # We choose the size of the reaction time step as 200 years, small enough 
    # so that it can accurately model melting and freezing. 
    set Reaction time step                     = 2e2

    # Additionally, we always want to do at least 10 operator splitting time 
    # steps in each model time step, to accurately compute the reactions.

# We use the melt simple material model that includes melting and freezing of
# melt for an average mantle composition that is characteristic for a mid-ocean 
# ridge setting, and mainly use its default parameters. 
# In particular, we have to define how fast melting and freezing should be. 
# We assume that both reactions happen on a time scale of 200 years (or a rate 
# of 5e-3/year), which should be substantially shorter than the time step size, 
# so that the melt fraction will always be close to equilibrium. 
# As the model includes melting and freezing, we do not have to extract any melt.
