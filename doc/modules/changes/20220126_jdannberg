Fixed: Compressible models with periodic boundaries that did not also
have one or more open boundaries did not correctly apply the necessary
pressure right-hand side compatibility modification when solving the
Stokes equations. This generally caused the linear solver to fail or to
take many more iterations than necessary. The right-hand side pressure
compatibility modification is now applied correctly, fixing this problem
and allowing it to use periodic boudaries in compressible models.
