New: The "Compositional fields" subsection in ASPECT has a new parameter called
"Types of fields" that is used to specify the types of all the
"compositional" fields. Supported types are currently
"chemical composition", "stress", "grain size", "porosity", "generic"
and "unspecified". The parameter is used to fill a vector of
CompositionalFieldDescription objects that store metadata about each field.
This vector can be called from within material models
via this->introspection().get_field_descriptions().
