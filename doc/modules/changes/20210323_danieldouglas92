New: Added a cutoff stress to Rheology::PeierlsCreep.

In parameterisations of the Peierls creep flow law where the 
power law stress exponent is equal to zero, the strain rate 
does not approach zero as the stress drops to zero. This is 
a problem, because the iterative solve for the equilibrium 
stress may yield a negative stress at low strain rates 
(which results in a negative viscosity).

The Peierls creep rheology module now includes a parameter 
"Cutoff stresses for Peierls creep". At stresses below the 
cutoff, the strain rate is modelled as a quadratic function 
of the stress (edot_ii = astress^2 + bstress). This effectively 
means that Peierls creep transitions into power law creep and 
then a linear rheology as stress decreases below the cutoff.
