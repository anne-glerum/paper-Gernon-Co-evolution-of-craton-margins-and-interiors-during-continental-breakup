       * This class is used to store all the necessary information to translate
       * between the data structure of the particle properties (a flat vector of
       * doubles) and the semantic meaning of these properties. It contains
       * information about the three layers of particle property information:
       *
       * By 'property plugins' we mean each separate class that is derived from
       * aspect::Particle::Property::Interface<dim>, and that is selected in
       * the input file. This means in any model there are as many property
       * plugins as entries in the 'List of particle properties' input parameter.
       *
       * Each plugin can create one or more 'property fields'. Property fields
       * are interpreted as distinctly named particle properties. Most plugins
       * contain only one field, but some group distinctly named properties
       * into groups, such as the 'InitialComposition' plugin, which creates
       * one property field per compositional field and names the property
       * fields according to the compositional field names. When writing particle
       * data to output files each 'property field' will be written into a
       * separate output field.
       *
       * Last each field can contain several 'property components'
       * if it represents a vector or tensor property. These components can
       * not be named individually, but it is still important to be able to
       * know how many components belong to a particular field.
       *
       * Information that is often required by other algorithms is for example
       * the number of components (= number of doubles in the property vector)
       * of a particle field or plugin, and its position within the particle
       * property vector. All of this information might be required within
       * loops over all fields, or for a specific field either identified by
       * its index, or by its name.
