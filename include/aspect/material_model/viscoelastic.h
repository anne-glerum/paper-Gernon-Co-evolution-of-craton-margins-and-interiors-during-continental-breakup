    /**
     * An implementation of a simple linear viscoelastic rheology that only
     * includes the deviatoric components of elasticity. Specifically, the
     * viscoelastic rheology only takes into account the elastic shear
     * strength (e.g., shear modulus), while the tensile and volumetric
     * strength (e.g., Young's and bulk modulus) are not considered. The model
     * is incompressible and allows specifying an arbitrary number of
     * compositional fields, where each field represents a different rock type
     * or component of the viscoelastic stress tensor. The stress tensor in 2D
     * and 3D, respectively, contains 3 or 6 components. The compositional fields
     * representing these components must be named and listed in a very specific
     * format, which is designed to minimize mislabeling stress tensor components
     * as distinct 'compositional rock types' (or vice versa). For 2D models,
     * the first three compositional fields must be labeled ve_stress_xx, ve_stress_yy
     * and ve_stress_xy. In 3D, the first six compositional fields must be labeled
     * ve_stress_xx, ve_stress_yy, ve_stress_zz, ve_stress_xy, ve_stress_xz, ve_stress_yz.
     *
     * Expanding the model to include non-linear viscous flow (e.g.,
     * diffusion/dislocation creep) and plasticity would produce a constitutive
     * relationship commonly referred to as partial elastoviscoplastic
     * (e.g., pEVP) in the geodynamics community. While extensively discussed
     * and applied within the geodynamics literature, notable references include:
     * Moresi et al. (2003), J. Comp. Phys., v. 184, p. 476-497.

     *
     * The overview below directly follows Moresi et al. (2003) eqns. 23-32.
     * However, an important distinction between this material model and
     * the studies above is the use of compositional fields, rather than
     * particles, to track individual components of the viscoelastic stress
     * tensor. The material model will be updated when an option to track
     * and calculate viscoelastic stresses with particles is implemented.
     *
     * Moresi et al. (2003) begins (eqn. 23) by writing the deviatoric
     * rate of deformation ($\hat{D}$) as the sum of elastic
     * ($\hat{D_{e}}$) and viscous ($\hat{D_{v}}$) components:
     * $\hat{D} = \hat{D_{e}} + \hat{D_{v}}$.
     * These terms further decompose into
     * $\hat{D_{v}} = \frac{\tau}{2\eta}$ and
     * $\hat{D_{e}} = \frac{\overset{\nabla}{\tau}}{2\mu}$, where
     * $\tau$ is the viscous deviatoric stress, $\eta$ is the shear viscosity,
     * $\mu$ is the shear modulus and $\overset{\nabla}{\tau}$ is the
     * Jaumann corotational stress rate. This later term (eqn. 24) contains the
     * time derivative of the deviatoric stress ($\dot{\tau}$) and terms that
     * account for material spin (e.g., rotation) due to advection:
     * $\overset{\nabla}{\tau} = \dot{\tau} + {\tau}W -W\tau$.
     * Above, $W$ is the material spin tensor (eqn. 25):
     * $W_{ij} = \frac{1}{2} \left (\frac{\partial V_{i}}{\partial x_{j}} -
     * \frac{\partial V_{j}}{\partial x_{i}} \right )$.
     *
     * The Jaumann stress-rate can also be approximated using terms from the time
     * at the previous time step ($t$) and current time step ($t + \Delta t^{e}$):
     * $\smash[t]{\overset{\nabla}{\tau}}^{t + \Delta t^{e}} \approx
     * \frac{\tau^{t + \Delta t^{e} - \tau^{t}}}{\Delta t^{e}} -
     * W^{t}\tau^{t} + \tau^{t}W^{t}$.
     * In this material model, the size of the time step above ($\Delta t^{e}$)
     * can be specified as the numerical time step size or an independent fixed time
     * step. If the latter case is a selected, the user has an option to apply a
     * stress averaging scheme to account for the differences between the numerical
     * and fixed elastic time step (eqn. 32). If one selects to use a fixed elastic time
     * step throughout the model run, this can still be achieved by using CFL and
     * maximum time step values that restrict the numerical time step to a specific time.
     *
     * The formulation above allows rewriting the total rate of deformation (eqn. 29) as
     * $\tau^{t + \Delta t^{e}} = \eta_{eff} \left (
     * 2\hat{D}^{t + \triangle t^{e}} + \frac{\tau^{t}}{\mu \Delta t^{e}} +
     * \frac{W^{t}\tau^{t} - \tau^{t}W^{t}}{\mu}  \right )$.
     *
     * The effective viscosity (eqn. 28) is a function of the viscosity ($\eta$),
     * elastic time step size ($\Delta t^{e}$) and shear relaxation time
     * ($ \alpha = \frac{\eta}{\mu} $):
     * $\eta_{eff} = \eta \frac{\Delta t^{e}}{\Delta t^{e} + \alpha}$
     * The magnitude of the shear modulus thus controls how much the effective
     * viscosity is reduced relative to the initial viscosity.
     *
     * Elastic effects are introduced into the governing stokes equations through
     * an elastic force term (eqn. 30) using stresses from the previous time step:
     * $F^{e,t} = -\frac{\eta_{eff}}{\mu \Delta t^{e}} \tau^{t}$.
     * This force term is added onto the right-hand side force vector in the
     * system of equations.
     *
     * The value of each compositional field representing distinct
     * rock types at a point is interpreted to be a volume fraction of that
     * rock type. If the sum of the compositional field volume fractions is
     * less than one, then the remainder of the volume is assumed to be
     * 'background material'.
     *
     * Several model parameters (densities, elastic shear moduli,
     * thermal expansivities, thermal conductivies, specific heats) can
     * be defined per-compositional field. For each material parameter the
     * user supplies a comma delimited list of length N+1, where N is the
     * number of compositional fields. The additional field corresponds to
     * the value for background material. They should be ordered
     * ``background, composition1, composition2...''. However, the first 3 (2D)
     * or 6 (3D) composition fields correspond to components of the elastic
     * stress tensor and their material values will not contribute to the volume
     * fractions. If a single value is given, then all the compositional fields
     * are given that value. Other lengths of lists are not allowed. For a given
     * compositional field the material parameters are treated as constant,
     * except density, which varies linearly with temperature according to the
     * thermal expansivity.
     *
     * When more than one compositional field is present at a point, they are
     * averaged arithmetically. An exception is viscosity, which may be averaged
     * arithmetically, harmonically, geometrically, or by selecting the
     * viscosity of the composition with the greatest volume fraction.
