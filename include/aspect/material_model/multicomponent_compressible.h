    /**
     * A material model which is intended for use with multiple compositional
     * fields. Each compositional field is meant to be a single rock type,
     * where the value of the field at a point is interpreted to be the
     * mass fraction of that rock type. If the sum of the compositional field
     * mass fractions is less than one, then the remainder of the mass is
     * assumed to be ``background mantle''.  If the sum of the compositional
     * field mass fractions is greater than one, then they are renormalized
     * to sum to one and there is no background mantle.
     *
     * For each material parameter the user supplies a comma delimited list of
     * length N+1, where N is the number of compositional fields.  The
     * additional field corresponds to the value for background mantle.  They
     * should be ordered ``background, composition1, composition2...''
     *
     * If a single value is given, then all the compositional fields are given
     * that value. Other lengths of lists are not allowed.  The material
     * parameters for each compositional field are derived from the
     * multicomponent compressible equation of state, and are pressure and
     * temperature dependent.
     *
     * When more than one field is present at a point, they are either averaged
     * self-consistently (for equation of state properties) or arithmetically
     * (for thermal conductivity). For the special case of viscosity, the user
     * may select from a variety of averaging schemes:
     * arithmetic, harmonic, geometric, or by selecting the
     * viscosity of the composition with the greatest volume fraction.
