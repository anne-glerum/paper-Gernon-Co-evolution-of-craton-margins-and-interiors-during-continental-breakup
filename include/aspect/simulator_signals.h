   * A class that collects the definition of signals that can be triggered
   * at different points in a computation. A signal is in essence an event
   * that is triggered whenever the program passes a certain point in a
   * computation. Parties interested in any of these signals can attach
   * "slots" to a signal. A slot is, in essence, a function that is called
   * whenever the signal is triggered. Multiple slots (or none) can be
   * attached to the same signal. To be as general as possible, slots are
   * not actually just pointers to functions, but std::function objects
   * that have a certain signature. Consequently, they can have much more
   * complicated types than just function pointers, such as objects with
   * an <code>operator()</code> or lambda functions.
   *
   * The documentation of each of the signals below indicates when
   * exactly it is called.
