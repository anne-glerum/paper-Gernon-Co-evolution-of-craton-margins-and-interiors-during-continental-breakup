       * This postprocessor calculates and outputs the timescale for the rotation
       * of grains toward the infinite strain axis. Kaminski and Ribe (2002, Gcubed)
       * call this quantity $\tau_{ISA}$, and define it as
       * $\tau_{ISA} \approx \frac{1}{\dot{\epsilon}}$
       * where $\dot{\epsilon}$ is the largest eigenvalue of the strain rate tensor.
       * It can be used, along with the grain lag angle
       * ($\Theta$), to calculate the grain orientation lag parameter (GOL).
       * GOL is not calculated within ASPECT
       * right now because it is proportional to the spatial gradient of theta, but in the
       * future that calculation could be implemented in a material model with CopyOutputs
       * (once they exist). For more thoughts on that, see the documentation for the
       * grain lag angle postprocessor.
