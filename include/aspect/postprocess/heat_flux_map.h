       * In summary, the method solves the temperature equation again on the boundary faces, with known
       * temperatures and solving for the boundary fluxes that satisfy the equation. Since the
       * equation is only formed on the faces and it can be solved using only diagonal matrices,

       * gradient on the face are significantly less accurate.

       * The function returns a solution vector, which contains the heat flux in the temperature
       * block of the vector.
