    /**
     * A geometry model class that describes a chunk of a spherical shell,
     * but with two boundary indicators per side boundary. This allows
     * for specifying two different types of boundary conditions on the
     * side boundaries, for example prescribed plate motions along
     * the edge of the lithosphere and an open boundary underneath.
     * In 2D, this class simulates a sector with inner and outer radius, and
     * minimum and maximum longitude. Longitude increases anticlockwise
     * from the positive x-axis, as per the mathematical convention of phi.
     * In 3D, the class simulates a chunk of a sphere, bounded by arbitrary
     * lines of longitude, latitude and radius. Boundary indicator names are
     * lowerwest, upperwest, lowereast, uppereast, lowersouth, uppersouth,
     * lowernorth, uppernorth, bottom and top.
     *
     * The parameters that describe this geometry and that are read from the
     * input file are the inner, outer and middle boundary radius of the shell,
     * the minimum and maximum longitude, minimum and maximum longitude, and the
     * number of cells initialised in each dimension. In the radial direction,
     * this number should be specified for both the lower and the upper part of
     * the chunk (with their boundary lying at the middle boundary radius).
     *
     * Initial topography can be added through a radial displacement of the
     * mesh nodes.
