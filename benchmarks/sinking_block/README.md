In order to run the benchmark for many resolution, density and viscosity combinations use the 
run_benchmark shell script. This makes use of the blank.prm file which serves as a basis for 
all the input files generated inside the triple loop.
The sinking_block.prm input file is the standalone prm file for the sinking block benchmark.
