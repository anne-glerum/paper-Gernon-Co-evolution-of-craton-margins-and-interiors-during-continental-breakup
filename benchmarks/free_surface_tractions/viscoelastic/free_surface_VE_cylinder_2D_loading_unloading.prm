# This model applies a surface load (using the traction
# boundary condition) on a free surface overlying
# a viscoelastic box. It approximates the analytical solution
# of Nakiboglu and Lambeck (1982) for an applied/removed
# axisymmetric cylindrical load over a viscoelastic half-space.

# Modified such that linear unloading occurs at intermediate
# time steps. Compare to soln_reload files.
