# This parameter file constructs a simple shear benchmark, which is adapted from Farrington et al. 2014,
# (Geophysics, Geochemsitry, Geosystems). A uniform material undergoes simple shear at a constant rate
# up until time=1.  At this point the shearing velocity is reduced to zero, and elastic stresses relax.
# The rheology is viscoelastic plastic, with a cohesion value of 3.5. This value is slightly
# higher than the visco-elastic stress at time=1, meaning that yielding does not occur, and the
# analytic (visco-elastic) solution should be reasonably well approximated. If the cohesion value is reduced
# to below the shear stress value at time t=1 (~3.1411), the shear stress will reach and remain
# at this value until after time t=1 when stresses begin to relax.
# This setup demonstrates an important difference between viscoelastic plastic, and visco-plastic rheology.
# In a comparable setup, the visco-plastic rheology will exhibit yielding in the first velocity iteration,
# as the value pre-yield stress magnitude is 3.5.
# The analytic solution follows the expression in Farrington et al., and describes the
# non-viscous portion of the total stress. This is equivalent to the magnitude of the stored stress
# history tensor. The three independent components of this tensor are tracked with compositional fields
# (ve_stress_xx, ve_stress_yy, ve_stress_xy). The choice of elastic timestip (Fixed elastic time step) and
# numerical timestep (Maximum time step) determine the degree of convergence with the analytic
# solution. The values set in the parameter file (0.1) produce a close fit to the analytical solution.
# The stress values are tracked through time in the log file using the composition statistics postprocessor,
# which reports the min, max, and average value of each compositional field after each time step. Given
# that there is no discrepancy between the numerical and elastic time steps and stress averaging is not invoked,
# the min, max, and average stress values remain equal over time.
