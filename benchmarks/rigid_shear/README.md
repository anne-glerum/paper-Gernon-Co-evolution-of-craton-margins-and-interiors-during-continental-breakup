This directory contains the "Rigid shear" benchmark for which a known solution
is available. The necessary code lives in the plugin/ subdirectory, while
instantaneous and time-dependent version of the benchmark are in the
corresponding subdirectories. Each directory has a "run_all_models" shell
script that will run the benchmark setups and a "create_formatted_tables.sh"
script that formats the output into readable text files. For a more
detailed description of the benchmark see Gassmoeller et al. (2019), "Evaluating
the Accuracy of Hybrid Finite Element/Particle-In-Cell Methods for
Modeling Incompressible Stokes Flow", Geophysical Journal International, 219, 3.
