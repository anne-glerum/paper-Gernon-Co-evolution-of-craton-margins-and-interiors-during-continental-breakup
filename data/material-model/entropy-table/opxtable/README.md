This data is example data produced by HeFESTo [1,2] for orthopyroxene under
pressure-entropy conditions that occur in the Earth's mantle. The data itself
is only useful for benchmarking the method as done in
benchmarks/entropy\_adiabat. Its resolution is too coarse for realistic models.

The file 'material_table.txt' contain the data that is used by ASPECT. The file
'1600K_adiabat.txt' contains the reference data for an example adiabat, which
can be optionally be used by the 'ascii data' adiabatic conditions plugin. The
files 'header_adiabat.txt', 'header_table.txt', and
'reformat_and_subsample_original_table.py' contain supplementary tools to
generate new tables starting from a new original HeFESTo data table (not
included).
